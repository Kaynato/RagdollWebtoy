next to do:

	margin correcting

	separation of both left and right margins

	clickbox for lying down
		(left, top margins)

	??
	sliding down edge of screen when hit with low velocity
		check low velocity and set a state.
			REQ SPRITE
		have vertical friction or something

			if xvel small
				setstate slidedown(side)

		in physics
			if state is slidedown
				diminish yvel

	holes
		teleport to above top

		also tipping into a hole
			REQ SPRITE
			check proximity to hole and xVel
			if we're going fast enough we fall right in
			if on border we will trip and this will have a chance (depd on xvel)

			if any yvel
				over hole entirely
					fall in
				intersecting edge
					teeter state(xvel)
			else if any xvel
				if too fast
					trip(xvel)
				else if pretty fast
					teeter state(xvel)
				else
					idle


	limit on absolute jumpspeed or whatever

		use an function asymptotic(insert, limit, factor)
			should be like a high-pass filter sorta thing??

	draggable teddy bear which makes happiness if close

		check dist to bear.
		bear should do the flipping 'n such too with the .flip class
		bear should also mass

	contentedness

		at alone_0 use ff_idleh instead of ff_idle
		also yes REQ SPRITE
